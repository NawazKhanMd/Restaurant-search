# QnA

# 1)
Time Taken : 5 Hours,
Preferred Additions : a Couple of UI Animations, Browser Location API (To auto detect the location), A better API Response to display Good reviewed Restaurants.
# 2) 
Most Liked Feature
React Hooks:: Makes code Simpler and easier to understand
# 3) 
Tracking Latencies
Preformance Tab in Dev tools: Helps you understand how much time a UI is taking to update/load. Had to split code and make smaller parts so that huge ui is divided to two small parts and latency is reduced.
# 4) 
API improvements
Will Enable CORS in the first change, will add more restaurant features like : whats famous in the restaurant and Reviews for the restaurant, and cards should match the restaurant Theme Example (if its Chinese Card theme is liitle different, if its Italian its little different
